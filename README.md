# New version of code written in TS
# Game design ideas
This is dark-style simulation game that I've still not ready to give it a name.  
If u want to ask what it looks like, my answer is that I got some inspiration from games I played like Anno 1800, Oxygen Not Incluede and Stellaris, I agree that these are perfect games but its not overall like the "simulation" im actually anticipating.  
So im gonna write my own version.
# Focus
I personlly enjoy stairing the screen to see how everything is going smoothly, and the "pefect state" im looking for is let the game run itself i can literally AFK. And this is going to be the part im very focusing on when stepping into the numerical design part.  
Ill make the "easy mode" really easy as I know there exists someone like me enjoying bullying machine.  
However, if u want more challenge, here is what i can offer:  
1. The old schooled "higher consumption", "higher maintenence", "disaster", etc
2. Inflation like real world economic  
3. Delay in marketing  
4. adding more of these
